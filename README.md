# use-resize-observer

React implementation of the [Resize Observer API] to tell you when an element
resizes.

**Demo**: TODO

# Features

- 🎣 **Hooks API** - With `useResizeObserver` it's easier than ever to monitor
  the size changes of your elements. Just pass a ref!
- ⚙️ **Alternative Native API** - Intuitive to use. Pass a dom element and an
  optional function to handle resizeObserver callbacks.
- 💨 **Optimized Performance** - Reuse Resize Observer instances whenever
  possible.
- 💥 **Tiny Footprint**

> ⚠️ It's recommended to add
> [`resize-observer-polyfill`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resize-observer-polyfill)
> for full browser support. This package dynamically polyfills ResizeObserver
> based on the browser.
